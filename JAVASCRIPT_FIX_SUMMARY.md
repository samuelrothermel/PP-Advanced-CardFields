# JavaScript Loading Issue - RESOLVED

## The Problem

When Apple Pay code was included, **ALL JavaScript stopped working** on PC (PayPal buttons, credit/debit fields, etc.) because of:

### 1. **Syntax Errors in JavaScript**

- Malformed nested if-else statements in the DOMContentLoaded event
- Duplicate closing brackets and missing structure
- JavaScript parser couldn't continue after hitting syntax errors

### 2. **Uncaught Exceptions Breaking Script Execution**

- `ApplePaySession.canMakePayments()` throws exceptions on non-Apple devices
- These exceptions weren't properly caught, breaking the entire script
- No try-catch wrapping around Apple Pay detection code

### 3. **Improper Error Handling**

- Apple Pay setup failures would crash the entire page JavaScript
- No graceful degradation when Apple Pay wasn't available
- Critical path dependencies (PayPal SDK loading was blocked by Apple Pay errors)

## The Solution

### âœ… **1. Fixed Syntax Errors**

- Corrected nested if-else statement structure
- Removed duplicate code blocks
- Proper closing of all conditional statements

### âœ… **2. Added Comprehensive Error Handling**

```javascript
// Wrapped Apple Pay detection in try-catch
try {
  if (ApplePaySession?.canMakePayments()) {
    // Apple Pay setup
  }
} catch (canMakePaymentsError) {
  console.warn('Apple Pay check failed - continuing with other methods');
}
```

### âœ… **3. Reorganized Loading Priority**

```javascript
// Load PayPal components FIRST (critical path)
loadPayPalComponents();

// Try Apple Pay setup SECOND (optional)
try {
  // Apple Pay setup wrapped in try-catch
} catch (applePayError) {
  // Continue without Apple Pay
}
```

### âœ… **4. Better Device Detection**

- Check for Apple Pay availability without throwing exceptions
- Graceful messages for PC/Windows users
- No more breaking the entire page on unsupported devices

## Result

âœ… **On PC/Windows:**

- PayPal buttons load and work perfectly
- Credit/debit card fields render properly
- Apple Pay shows informational message instead of errors
- No JavaScript errors in console

âœ… **On Mac/iOS:**

- All payment methods work including Apple Pay
- Proper HTTPS requirement detection
- Better error messages for debugging

## Test URLs

- **Full checkout with Apple Pay:** http://localhost:8888/checkout
- **Test without Apple Pay:** http://localhost:8888/test-no-applepay

Both should now work perfectly on PC! ðŸŽ‰
