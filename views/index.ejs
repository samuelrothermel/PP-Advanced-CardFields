      <h2>Tools Used</h2>
        <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/sdk/js/">JavaScript SDK</a>
          <ul>
            <li>Renders payment buttons, card form fields, pay later messaging, and more.</li>
            <li>Also used to check the funding-eligibility of a given payment method.</li>
          </ul>
        <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/orders/v2/">Orders API</a> aka Orders v2
          <ul>
            <li>Used to create, update, retrieve, authorize, and capture orders.</li>
          </ul>
        <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/payment-tokens/v3/">Payment Method Tokens API</a> aka Vault v3
          <ul>
            <li>Saves payment methods so payers don't have to enter details for future transactions.</li>
            <li>The API associates a payment method with a temporary setup token. Pass the setup token to the API to exchange the setup token for a permanent token.</li>
            <li>The permanent token represents a payment method that has been saved to the merchant's PayPal vault.</li>
            <li>This token can be used repeatedly for returning checkout or recurring transactions such as recurring payments.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Best Practices</h2>
        <h3>One-Time Payments</h3>
          <a href="/one-time-payments-cart">Product/Cart Page</a>
          <ul>
            <li>Typically found on Product or Cart pages.</li>
            <li>Shipping Method, Shipping Option and Contact Information received from PayPal via client-side callback.</li>
            <li>NOTE: Server-side callback is preferred when integrating via native mobile applications. For example, Venmo does not support client-side callbacks (thus will not appear).</li>
            <li>NOTE: You will need to publicly expose any server-side callback URL you wish to utilize when attempting server-side callbacks.</li>
          </ul>
          <a href="/one-time-payments-checkout">Checkout Page</a>
            <ul>
            <li>Customers can save their payment method for future use. This is done via the Payment Method Token API.</li>
            <li>Customers can also save their payment method without making a purchase.</li>
          </ul>
